<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<p>
	This is just the ratio; calcuate for a ~3-4 lb cut of pork from the grocery
	store.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>1 lb</td>
		<td>boneless pork</td>
	</tr>
	<tr class="gap"></tr>
	<tr>
		<td>2 Tbs</td>
		<td>vinegar</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3 Tbs</td>
		<td>soy sauce</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>4 Tbs</td>
		<td>sugar</td>

	<tr>
		<td>5 Tbs</td>
		<td>water, pineapple juice (recommended), or Coca-Cola</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2>Procedure</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Cut pork into bite-sized (~1 inch) chunks.</li>
	<li>Place pork into a boiling pot of water until barely browned.</li>
	<li>
		<b>Remove pork from water</b>
		then put it
		<b>separately</b>
		into a large pot. Add ingredients. [It is easiest to strain the pork out ->
		dump boiling water -> reuse the pot.]
	</li>
	<li>
		Cook on medium heat, adding some water occasionally to prevent burning. [You
		want the sauce to thicken and caramelize, turning brown a bit and coating
		the meat... so don't add more water too quickly or you lose that color and
		sweet coating.] Leave the lid halfway off so the liquid will evaporate and
		sugars will caramelize. Stir occasionally.
	</li>
	<li>
		Leave for ~2-3 hours, until the pork is tender and a bit of sauce remains.
	</li>
	<li>
		Serve alongside (or mixed with) steamed rice. Excellent as a packed lunch.
	</li>
</ol>
